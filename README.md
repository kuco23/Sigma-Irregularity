[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/kuco23/sigma-irregularity/master)

## Problem
The task is to maximize the ratio of two graph irregularity measures,
for graphs G_n of order n, thus discovering additional properties
and connections between those extremal graphs.
